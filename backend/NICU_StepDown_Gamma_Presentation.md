# NICU Step-Down Unit: Optimizing Pediatric Bed Utilization at UCLA Health

---

## Executive Overview
**Objective:**
Create a NICU Step-Down Unit to optimize bed utilization, improve patient outcomes, and increase revenue at UCLA Health Ronald Reagan Medical Center.

---

## The Problem
**Three Critical Challenges:**
- Low-acuity NICU patients occupying general pediatric beds.
- Extended NICU stays leading to health deterioration.
- High-acuity NICU patients being turned away due to capacity constraints.

---

## Financial & Clinical Impact
**Current State Consequences:**
- Revenue loss from inability to accept high-acuity patients.
- Inefficient resource allocation across pediatric units.
- Suboptimal patient outcomes due to inappropriate care levels.
- Nursing staff strain due to bed blocking issues.

---

## Key Data Insight
**NICU Overflow Unit Analysis:**
- 30% shorter average length of stay vs. standard NICU.
- Seasonal patient peaks (flu/cold/infections).
- Predominantly low-acuity neonates.
- Ideal for step-down conversion.

---

## The Solution
**Action Plan:**
Convert NICU Overflow Unit into a dedicated NICU Step-Down Unit by:
- Relocating Fetal Diagnostic Center to the MP 200 building.
- Freeing space on UCLA Floor 5 for the step-down unit.
- Creating seamless patient flow: NICU → Step-Down → General Pediatrics.

---

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- UCLA Floor 5 (Fetal Diagnostics + Triage)
- MP 200 Ronald Reagan building  
- NICU Overflow conversion
- Transfer protocols

**Out of Scope:**
- OBED, Santa Monica, L&D beds

---

## Patient Flow Logic
**Optimized Care Pathway:**
1. High-acuity neonates admitted to NICU.
2. Improved patients transfer to Step-Down (not ready for general care).
3. Low-acuity patients move to General Pediatrics.
4. NICU capacity freed for new high-acuity admissions.

---

## Expected Benefits
**Clinical:**
- Appropriate level-of-care placements.
- Reduced health deterioration risk.
- Improved family experience.

**Financial:**
- Increased high-acuity patient acceptance (+15-20%).
- Reduced bed blocking costs.
- Revenue per bed optimization.
- Competitive market advantage.

---

## Implementation Roadmap
**Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Facility Planning
- Relocate Fetal Diagnostic Center.
- Design step-down unit layout.

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Clinical Development  
- Staff training programs.
- Protocol establishment.
- Equipment procurement.

**Phase 3 (Months 5-6):** Launch & Optimization
- Soft opening with monitoring.
- Full operations with continuous improvement.
