# Presentation: NICU Step-Down Unit - Optimizing Pediatric Bed Utilization at UCLA Health

---

## 1. Introduction

**Title:** NICU Step-Down Unit - Optimizing Pediatric Bed Utilization at UCLA Health

**Executive Summary:**
The UCLA Health NICU Step-Down Unit project aims to optimize pediatric bed utilization, alleviate overcapacity, enhance patient outcomes, and improve financial performance by efficiently managing patient flow from NICU to step-down and general pediatric care.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Challenges:
- Low-acuity NICU patients occupying general pediatric beds.
- Extended NICU stays leading to health deterioration.
- Hospital declines high-acuity cases due to capacity constraints.
- Inefficient utilization leads to revenue loss and patient care issues.

---

## 3. Project Goal

### Objectives:
- Optimize bed utilization in Pediatrics.
- Improve patient outcomes and efficiency.
- Enhance revenue through better resource allocation.
- Develop effective patient flow protocols.

---

## 4. Key Insight - NICU Overflow Analysis

### Observations:
- Shorter length of stay in NICU Overflow compared to other NICU units.
- Patients during peak seasons often low-acuity; need an alternative to full NICU care.

**Opportunity:** Convert NICU Overflow Unit into NICU Step-Down Unit.

---

## 5. Project Scope

### In Scope:
- UCLA Floor 5: Fetal Diagnostics + Triage
- MP 200 Building at Ronald Reagan Hospital
- NICU Overflow Unit conversion
- NICU → Step-Down → General Pediatrics transfer processes

### Out of Scope:
- OBED
- Other UCLA Ronald Reagan Floors
- Santa Monica Facilities
- Labor & Delivery Beds

## 8. Timeline

- **April 2024:** Problem identification and data analysis
- **April 26, 2024:** Scope definition
- **May-June 2024:** NICU patient flow and stay analysis
- **July 26, 2024:** Stakeholder meetings
- **July 29, 2024:** Key meeting with Alan and NICU Clinical Director
- **August 29, 2024:** Follow-up meeting

---

## 9. Key Data Points

- NICU Overflow has a shorter length of stay.
- Patient volume peaks seasonally.
- Transfer metrics: NICU → General Pediatrics.
- Age-based care levels: NICU → PICU.

---

## 10. Patient Flow Logic

- Transition neonates from NICU to Step-Down if they improve but aren't ready for general care.
- Prevents premature discharges and optimizes capacity.

---

## 11. Financial Impact

- **Increased Revenue:** Higher intake of high-acuity NICU patients.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduced bed blocking.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimal care placements.
- **Competitive Edge** in neonatal care.

---

## 12. Clinical Benefits

- Better health outcomes with appropriate care levels.
- Reduced health risks from long NICU stays.
- Improved family and nursing staff experience.

---

## 13. Implementation Strategy

1. Relocate Fetal Diagnostic Center to MP 200
2. Convert NICU Overflow into Step-Down Unit
3. Develop clinical protocols and staffing models
4. Train staff on new care standards
5. Establish seamless transfer protocols
6. Continuously monitor and optimize operations

---

## 14. Success Metrics

- High-acuity NICU acceptance rate improvement
- Reduction in general pediatric bed blocking
- Length of stay optimization
- Revenue per bed metrics
- Increased patient satisfaction scores
- Enhanced clinical outcomes

---

## Conclusion

**Call to Action:** 
The NICU Step-Down Unit project promises improved patient outcomes, optimized resource utilization, and financial growth. Support and collaboration from all stakeholders is vital to its success.
